This is a small private project.

I wrote it to help me, and maybe others to better understand the fingerboard of a string instrument (for my needs the electric bass). I wrote it in a way that all string instruments (where you know how many frets it has) would be configurable.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

To run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

to create a build

```bash
yarn build
```

Best way to see and develop the components isolated

```bash
yarn storybook
```

to run the tests you can use

```bash
yarn test
```

or for continuing testing with a file watcher

```bash
yarn test:watch
```
